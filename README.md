# Leaked Shots

[Leaked Shots](https://robertoreale.me/leakedshots) is my ongoing photography project. The live site is built upon [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), together with the [Photography](https://github.com/ramswaroop/photography) theme by [ramswaroop](https://github.com/ramswaroop).

My research in photography centers around street photography, portraits, and architecture. You can also check out my [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/people/roberto_reale) profile or my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/leakedshots) account.
 
All the pictures were taken by me.
